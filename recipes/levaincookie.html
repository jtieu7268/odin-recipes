        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe comes from <a href="https://www.modernhoney.com/levain-bakery-chocolate-chip-crush-cookies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modern Honey</a>. 
            It is a close re-creation of the infamous chocolate chip walnut cookies from Levain Bakery. 
            This copycat recipe is gooey and substantial, perfect for when you're craving the cookies, but aren't in NYC.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup cold butter, cut into small cubes</li>
            <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1 and 1/2 cups cake flour (can substitute for all-purpose flour)</li>
            <li>1 and 1/2 cups flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cornstarch</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 cups chocolate chips</li>
            <li>2 cups walnuts, roughly chopped</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 410 degrees.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream together cold cubed butter, brown sugar, and sugar for 4 minutes or until creamy.</li>
            <li>Add eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each one.</li>
            <li>Stir in flours, cornstarch, baking soda, and salt. Mix until just combined to avoid overmixing.</li>
            <li>Stir in chocolate chips and walnuts.</li>
            <li>Separate dough into large balls and place on lightly colored cookie sheet. You will fit 4 cookies on one large cookie sheet. The dough makes 8 extra large cookies.</li>
            <li>Bake for 9-12 minutes or until golden brown on the top. Let them rest for at least 10 minutes to set.</li>
        </ol>
